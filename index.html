          but at the same time it also functioned as a testing ground for building a scraper and a crawler.</p>

      <p>1. Ken has beef with King Diamond. King Diamond doesn't know it. But it's very real. <br>
        2. He once made a fake real estate site for his teachers' homes. The accuracy was borderline unsettling. <br>
        3. He fears dragonflies more than deadlines. And he's met both in the wild. <br>
        4. Ken once built a vinyl shelf so emotionally charged, even the LED strips have commitment issues. <br>
        5. Photoshop? For Ken, it's less "image editing" and more "structured psychological release." <br>
        6. His CSS works beautifully until you open it in Firefox. Then it becomes interpretive art. <br>
        7. He believes Steve Perry could sing the terms and conditions and still make you cry. <br>
